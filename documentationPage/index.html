            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it's a language used in
            web development to control the presentation and layout of HTML
            documents. Imagine HTML as the skeleton of a webpage, providing the
            structure and content, while CSS is the skin that adds style, color,
            layout, and design to make it visually appealing.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS follows a hierarchy where styles can cascade, meaning rules can
            override each other based on their specificity. Inline styles
            (styles directly applied to an HTML element) have the highest
            priority, followed by IDs, classes, and then tag selectors.
            Specificity refers to how the browser decides which styles to apply
            when multiple rules conflict.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS allows you to create responsive websites that adapt to different
            screen sizes (like on mobile phones, tablets, or desktops) using
            techniques such as media queries, flexible layouts, and viewport
            settings.
          </p>
          <p>
            To start using CSS, you first need to link the HTML file to your
            external CSS file using the snippet below.
            <code class="example"
              >&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;</code
            >
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section id="selectors" class="main-section">
        <header><h1>Selectors</h1></header>
        <article>
          <h2>Types of Selectors</h2>
          <div class="selector_list">
            <h3>Universal Selectors</h3>
            <p>
              The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.
              <code class="example"
                >* { text-align: center; color: blue; }</code
              >
            </p>
            <h3>Type Selectors</h3>
            <p>
              A type selector (or element selector) will select all elements of
              the given element type, the syntax is just the name of the
              element.
              <code class="example">div { color: white; }</code>
            </p>
            <h3>ID Selectors</h3>
            <p>
              ID selectors are similar to class selectors, except they can only
              be used by ONE element.
              <code class="example">#title { background-color: red; }</code>
            </p>
            <h3>Grouping Selector</h3>
            <p>
              Two groups of elements that share some of the same style
              declarations can be stacked together using a comma-separated list
              to cut down on time, space, and repetition.
              <code class="example"
                >.read, .unread { color: white; background-color: black; }</code
              >
            </p>
          </div>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section id="display" class="main-section">
        <header><h1>Display</h1></header>
        <p>
          The display property specifies the display behavior (the type of
          rendering box) of an element.
        </p>
        <h2>Common Display Values</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><code>display: none;</code></li>
          <p>
            This is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements
            without deleting and recreating them. <br /><br />
            The default display value for most elements is block or inline.
          </p>
          <li><code>display: inline;</code></li>
          <p>
            An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as
            much width as necessary.
          </p>
          <li><code>display: block;</code></li>
          <p>
            A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the
            full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as
            it can).
          </p>
          <li><code>display: inline-block;</code></li>
          <li><code>display: flex;</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These values provide flexibility in creating various layouts and
          controlling how elements are presented on a webpage. The choice of
          display value significantly affects the behavior and positioning of
          elements in the document flow.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="position" class="main-section">
        <header><h1>Position</h1></header>
        <p>
          The position property specifies the type of positioning method used
          for an element.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>static</code></li>
          <p>
            HTML elements are positioned static by default. <br /><br />

            Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom,
            left, and right properties. <br /><br />

            An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special
            way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the
            page
          </p>
          <li><code>relative</code></li>
          <p>
            An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its
            normal position. <br /><br />

            Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a
            relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from
            its normal position.
          </p>
          <li><code>fixed</code></li>
          <p>
            An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the
            viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the
            page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are
            used to position the element. <br /><br />

            A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would
            normally have been located.
          </p>
          <li><code>absolute</code></li>
          <p>
            An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the
            nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the
            viewport, like fixed). <br /><br />

            However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned
            ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page
            scrolling.
          </p>
          <li><code>sticky</code></li>
          <p>
            An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's
            scroll position. <br /><br />

            A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on
            the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset
            position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like
            position:fixed).
          </p>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="float" class="main-section">
        <header><h1>Float</h1></header>
        <p>The float proprty is used for positioning and formatting content.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>left</code> - The element floats to the left of its container
          </li>
          <li><code>right</code></li>
          <li><code>none</code></li>
